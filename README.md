## The Concept
SaARbotage is an interactive augmented reality mobile game with a classic Werewolf character. A group wants to escape together from a broken space station to a new planet. The way is long, oxygen is short, time is running out. They have to stick together to get the spaceship to their destination in time. However, there are traitors among them - androids. These want to prevent the arrival of mankind on the new planet at all costs. Skillful hiding, lying and saarborting is mandatory to remain undetected part of the crew. Because at the end of each day the crew gets together and a suspect is thrown off the ship. But was it really an android?

SaARbotage is a challenging AR real time adventure game for 4 - 8 people. The game is played together in any location. Each player needs the SaARbotage application on their smartphone. At the beginning of the game, printed game cards are distributed over several physical spaces. All interactions with the spaceship (the app) take place by scanning the game cards. Interactions with crew members, however, take place face-to-face. 

The journey to the new planet takes several in-game days. Every day, machines need to be repaired; to do this, the machines at the respective stations are scanned and a mini-game starts. Different games require different numbers of players. Androids and humans must complete tasks in direct contact with each other, without knowing which of them is on which side. Androids try to make the lives of crew members more difficult by manipulating stations. these then consume more oxygen and shorten the lives of human crew members. They have to be clever in order to remain undetected or to be able to elegantly talk their way out of tricky situations. The entire crew meets once a day. They discuss the course of the day and suspicious behavior. Will the androids manage to spread bad blood among the crew members? Or will they be discovered and thrown off the ship?
